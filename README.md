# Go web application framework

# Features
- HTTP server
- testing


# How to Run:

Two ways:

1. Use the run.sh script file
2. Use the command "go build" followed by "./webgo" (I named this module "webgo")

NOTE: you might need to install npm and run "npm install react react-dom" before running this. or maybe that's just me.


# Info

All test files automatically run when the program starts. If tests fail, the program shuts down.
